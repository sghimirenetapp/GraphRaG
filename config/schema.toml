    -- Sample Data Insertion
    -- Hereâ€™s an example of how to insert a relationship between an OS family and an OS type:

    INSERT INTO OSFamily_OSType_Relationship ($from_id, $to_id)
    VALUES (
        (SELECT $node_id FROM OSFamilyNode WHERE OSFamilyId = 1),   -- Source node ID
        (SELECT $node_id FROM OSTypeNode WHERE OSTypeId = 1)        -- Target node ID
    );
